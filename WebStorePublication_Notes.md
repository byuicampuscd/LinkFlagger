# Before Publishing to Chrome Store - Things to correct

## Icon may be necessary

An Icon may be necessary to include in the manifest.

Here is a dummy icon until we get a real one. (I'm not really artistically creative/inclined).

## Create a Developer account

I'm assuming this was done and set up correctly by someone on the higher ups end?

## Upload your app

Uploading seems pretty straightforward, assuming we have a Developer Account

## Payment

I'm assuming we're omitting payment for the app.

## Provide Store Content

### NEEDED: 
A detailed description of your application. Write your description to entice users to download your app.
A 128x128 icon to display in the store. You may re-use your app icon here.
At least one 1280x800 or 640x400 screenshot or YouTube video to show off what your app does.
A 440x280 small tile icon that will be displayed on the Chrome Web Store wall.
The primary category where your app should be listed.
Your app's language to help users find it.

Description Example: 
This application is a collection of tools written by and for the Brigham Young University - Idaho Tech Ops Team to assist in backend work and development in the Brightspace Learning Managment System. 

## Pay the developer signup fee

I'm assuming this is done if we already have a developer account.

## Get app constraints and finish your app’s code

We won't need to worry about the Licensing API as we are not charging. I believe app constraints only apply if you need to charge, so we are in the clear I believe.

## Publishing to test accounts

This limits the app to only testing accounts. I believe it is just a whitelist defined at this step of the publication. You can do this list individually or as a group. More information on group set up can be found [here](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish#set-up-group-publishing)

## Publishing to the world

Simply select "Publish" next to your application on the dashboard page. 

## Potentially publishing the app privately????

If we wanted to keep the app private, and publish it so that it is only accessible via our domain, more information can be found [here](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/2663860?hl=en).
