    <h2>Link Flagger</h2>
    <p>The link flagger will scan every link tag in brightspace and see if it passes certain tests</p>
    <p>Differently colored links represent different issues:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Blue: No Title attribute found</li>
      <li>Yellow: Link does not open in a new tab</li>
      <li>Red: The filepath doesn't have the words 'Course Files' or 'Content Files'.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>HTML Fixer</h2>
    <p>The HTML Fixer was built to correct poorly marked up content pages on the transition from I-Learn 2.0. It will scan html in content pages, and fix many common issues.</p>
    <p>The tool ads a button to the edit html frame, which execute the following when clicked:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Changing &lt;b&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;</li>
      <li>Changing &lt;i&gt; to &lt;em&gt;</li>
      <li>Removing empty tags</li>
    </ul>
